Most engineering folks already know the technical side of interviews, but I want to emphasize the importance of soft skills to stand out.

One way to set yourself apart is to prepare thoughtful responses to behavioral questions. Take the time to make _NOTES_ and _PRACTICE_ your answers using the STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This approach helps you share compelling stories highlighting your impact and problem-solving abilities.

Speaking from experience, the answers to these questions often make all the difference. They break ties and elevate you above the rest.

Invest a little extra effort into this areaâ€”you'll thank yourself later.
